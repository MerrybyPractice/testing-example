# Project Requirements

## Completed Functionality 7/17/2020

1. Create a function to solve for the area of a square given the length of one side (a = s^2).
2. Store the calculated area in a square dict
3. Create a function to solve the area of a circle given the diameter. (Formula with Radius (A = pi r ^2, r = d/2) Diam 5 == area 19.63 (rounded)
4. Store the calculated are in a circle dict
5. Create a function to solve the area of a triangle given the base and the height. (A = 1/2bh) b = 4, h = 3 
6. Store the calcualted area in a triangle dict 

## Completed Functionality 7/24/2020
7. Retrive an area by shape and 1 size parameter.


## Functionality to finish


8. test 50 unique test cases for each exsisting method.
9. Write unit tests for the area methods and the retreival method that run without any input or knowledge that the other exsisting.



Done: 

Square dict exsists 
Square area exsists 
Square Area returns correctly (variety of cases)
Circle area exsists 
Circle Area returns correctly (variety of cases)
Triangle area exsists 
triangle area returns correctly (variety of cases)
